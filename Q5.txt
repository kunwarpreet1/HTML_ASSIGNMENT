Why do we use meta tags?

Meta tags are used in the <head> section of an HTML document to provide 
metadata to browsers, search engines, and social media platforms. 

metadata => information about the web page

They do not appear on the webpage but help with SEO, responsiveness, and performance.

common in HTML:-
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
